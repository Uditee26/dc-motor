# dc-motor
simulation is based on control mechanism using feedback loop of speed and current of dc motor
switching element is used to control forward and reverse motoring operation along with breaking 
conclusion : gate pulses are adjusted using speed and armature current as feedback and four quadrant operation is implemented in the simulation.
